> You can run `min run min-upgrade <folder>` to automatically upgrade all the `.min` files in `<folder>` and all its subfolders.

## New Features

- Upgraded OpenSSL to v3.2.0
- Added the `min run <mmm>` command to (download, install globally, and) execute the `main` symbol of the the specified [managed module](/learn-mmm/). For example this functionality can be used to upgrade `.min` files using the `min-upgrade` managed module.
- mmm: It is now possible to install, uninstall, and update modules by specifying them via `<name>@<version>`.
- mmm: The version is now optional when installing, uninstalling, and updating modules (the name of the HEAD branch will be used, e.g. "master" or "main", typically).

## Fixes and Improvements

- Added check to prevent installing local managed modules in the HOME directory or $HOME/mmm.
- Changed {#link-operator||global||tokenize#} symbol so that it returns the full token, including delimiters (for strings and comments).
- Fixed regression in `min compile` command introduced in the previews version due to parses changes.
